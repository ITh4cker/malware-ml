# Machine learning malware project
This project is my attempt to apply machine learning to static malware analysis
with a goal of identifying interesting files that should be examined further
during an investigation.

# Feature Selection
Here are some of the features I want to use in examining the executables:

* Number of PE sections
* Names of PE sections
* Entropy of PE sections
* DLL imports
* Function imports
* distribution of x86 instructions

## Prerequisite research
It might be necessary to have features such as "More than 5 PE sections" to run
the analysis. Where would the number 5 come from? I'll need to do some research
prior to the machine learning to find out what is normal for malware and what
is normal for benign files?

# Some tools to consider

* **pefile**: is a python library for identifying the pe sections of a file.
* **distorm**: python disassembler
